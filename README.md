# Mayan EDMS C# Example
This is simple example wrapper for communicating with Mayan EDMS's v4 API using C#

I make no warrenties. Do what you want with this code.
What I have provided you here should be more than enough to develop on.

Check out Program.cs to see the calls and MayanApiClient.cs to see how to make the calls.

Good luck.
